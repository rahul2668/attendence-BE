need to access the data in all pages (different pages)
browser - url -- contain -- all will call as a page, each contain have row, columns and in rows and columns will have component (

eg: linkedin
create a accont -- at homepage will have our data, in profile and another page will have our data that data is stored in one place that place is called state management, that data is used in all the components for every page.

2. create a new react project
if npx create-react-app react_app_name will not create app, the need to run the below commands to create the project
npm install create-react-app
npx create-react-app react_app_name

1. once you kept in reduce will access across all the application irespective of component.
2. eg: for every component have multiple fields - user, pwd, click ---> onclick function will allow to the API and internally need to store in use state or set state or will declare in one state declaration, for every method will have a function, onchange will have like a append function nothing but append as python eg, setStatement --  will use as a added varaibles to that.
